You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the Planetfall API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Bearer Token

When requesting resources, you will need your access token â€” you will find it in the [Dashboard](#) in the settings when you click on your profile picture. Here's how to add the token to the request header using cURL:

```bash 
curl https://api.planetfall.app/v1/TODO: \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pf_xxx"
```

Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.
