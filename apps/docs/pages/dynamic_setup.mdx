# Dynamic Setup

Setup instructionns allow you to dynamically configure running checks by
changing the request header, url, method or body before the check is executed.

Dynamic configuration can be useful when you want to use short lived tokens.

## How it works

<Steps>

### Before sending a request to your endpoint

If the endpoint is using dynamic setup instructions, we will call your setup
api before running the check with the following json payload:


```ts
{
  // The id of the endpoint to test.
  endpointId: string,
}
```

Your api must respond with a JSON object with the following properties:

```ts
{
  
  // The url to check, overwrites the original url from the check if present.
  url: string | undefined

  // Additional headers to add to the request, these will be merged with the
  // headers from the check and overwrite any existing headers with the same name.
  headers: Record<string, string> | undefined

  // The body to send with the request, overwrites the original body from the check 
  //if present.
  body: string | undefined
  
  // The method to use for the request, overwrites the original method from the check 
  // if present.
  method: "GET" | "POST" | "PUT" | "DELETE" | "OPTIONS" | undefined

}
```

### Cache dynamic setup instructions

The response from your setup api will be cached, the cache time can be configured.
For subsequent checks the cached response will be used instead of calling your setup api.

For example if your authorization JWT is valid for 10 minutes, you could set the cache time to 8 minutes.


<Callout type="info" >
  The response of your setup api will only be cached in memory and not persisted to disk or database.
</Callout>


### Merging dynamic setup instructions

All dynamic setup instructions are merged with the original check request before running it. Dynamic setup instructions will overwrite any existing headers, url, body or method from the check.

### Sending the request

After merging the dynamic setup instructions with the check, we will send the request to your endpoint and record its latency and response as usual.
